Book Management Project. The book management project is a Spring Boot application that provides REST APIs for managing a collection of books. The project allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book data.

Features:
Add new books with details like title, author, price, and ISBN.
Retrieve all books or search by ID, title, or ISBN.
Update book information.
Delete books by ID.
Implementation: Uses Spring Boot with REST controllers, a Book model, and a service interface for business logic.
Purpose The project demonstrates how to build a RESTful API using Spring Boot for managing data with CRUD operations. It can be a basis for more complex book management systems or similar applications.
